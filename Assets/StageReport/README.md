# Stage Recap

At the end of each stage, StageRecap shows all the interactables on the stage and how many you’ve collected. This helps players improve at full looting stages.

In multiplayer, the host must have the mod for it to work for other players.

## Configuration

You can edit the configuration in `Settings > Mod Options > StageRecap`. All configurations can be adjusted at any time, even in the middle of a run. In multiplayer, the host's configuration is used.
